# Deployment and configuration

At this moment Glasnost requires erlang/OTP, elixir and nodejs to be installed on the server. I'll be releasing a docker image in the next release.

Step by step [deployment instructions](https://github.com/cyberpunk-ventures/glasnost/blob/master/DEPLOYMENT.md) for a single author blog on your domain.

## Configuration example
```
export GLASNOST_SOURCE_BLOCKCHAIN=steem
export GLASNOST_BLOG_AUTHOR=ontofractal
```
